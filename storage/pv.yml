# Class: A PV can have a class, which is specified by setting the storageClassName attribute to the name of a StorageClass. A PV of a particular class can only be bound to PVCs requesting that class.

# Access modes
   # ReadWriteOnce – the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node ... RWO
   # ReadOnlyMany – the volume can be mounted read-only by many nodes ... ROX
   # ReadWriteMany – the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes ... RWX
