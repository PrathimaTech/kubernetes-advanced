CMD   executable arg1 arg2
        here executable & args can be overridden from command line 

       ex: the default command for ubuntu image is /bin/bash 
            docker run -d ubuntu sleep 10  -- this will overrde /bin/bash with sleep 10


ENTRYPOINT executable arg1 arg2

        here executbale is permanent with image & agrs can be overriden from commandline 

        ex:  vi dockerfile
             FROM ubuntu 
             ENTRYPOINT ["sleep", "10"]

             docker build -f dockerfile -t myubuntu:v1 .
            
            here the default command for ubuntu is set as ENTRYPOINT & sleep 10
            docker run -d ubunut sleep 10  -- this will add sleep 10 as args for default sleep 10
            command field looks like "sleep 10 sleep 10"
